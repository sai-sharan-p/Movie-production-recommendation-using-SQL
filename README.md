# Movie-production-recommendation-using-SQL
Using SQL &amp; IMDB data, I have tried to recommend the genre, cast &amp; crew to bring on board to produce an international movie which can become a biggest grocers. 


If a production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data then they can use this sort of approach. I have used the movie data from the IMDB website to analyse the movies that have been released in the past three years. I have analysed the data set and drew meaningful insights that can help any production company to start a new successful project.
